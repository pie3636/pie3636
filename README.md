Hi, I’m @pie3636

I’m interested in many things, such as cost-effective training and fine-tuning of large language models, stochastic simulations, tools for language learning and more.

You can find some past and current projects on this account.

For any queries, contact me directly at pie3636 (at) gmail (dot) com.
